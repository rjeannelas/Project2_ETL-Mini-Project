# Project2_ETL-Mini-Project

Practice building an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas to extract and transform the data.
Create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Before You Begin
Create a new repository, named Crowdfunding_ETL, for this project. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Rename the ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb file with your first name initial and last name, for example, ETL_Mini_Project_NRomanoff.ipynb. Then, add this Jupyter notebook file and the Resources folder containing the crowdfunding.xlsx and the contacts.xlsx files to your repository.

# Instructions

## Extract, transform, then export the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a Dataframe into the following subsections:

 ### Category and Subcategory DataFrames
 ### Campaign DataFrame
 ### Contacts DataFrame
 ### Crowdfunding Database
 ### Category and Subcategory DataFrames

# Final contact DataFrame
Create the Crowdfunding Database
Inspect the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD.
Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table in the correct order - verify that each table creation has the correct data.
