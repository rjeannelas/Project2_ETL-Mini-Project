# Project2_ETL-Mini-Project

Practice building an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas to extract and transform the data.
Create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

# Instructions

### Extract, transform, then export the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a Dataframe into the following subsections:

 #### Category and Subcategory DataFrames
 #### Campaign DataFrame
 #### Contacts DataFrame
 #### Crowdfunding Database
 #### Category and Subcategory DataFrames
 
### Create the Contacts DataFrame
#### Choose one of the following two options for extracting and transforming the data from the contacts.xlsx Excel data:
Option 1: Use Python dictionary methods.
Option 2: Use regular expressions.



### Final contact DataFrame
#### Create the Crowdfunding Database
Inspect the four CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD.
Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table in the correct order - verify that each table creation has the correct data.
